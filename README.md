# [Ai Interview Simulator] 🎯

## Basic Details

### Team Members
- Member 1: [Nile Varghese] - [GEC Thrissur]

### Hosted Project Link
[mention your project hosted link here]

### Project Description
[An interactive AI-powered interview simulator that generates role- and topic-specific questions, allows users to answer them, and evaluates responses to provide an overall probability of passing the interview.]

### The Problem statement
[Many job seekers struggle to practice interviews effectively and receive objective feedback. Existing solutions either provide generic questions or no scoring, leaving users unsure of their strengths and weaknesses.]

### The Solution
[This project generates tailored interview questions, collects user answers, evaluates them using an AI evaluator (Gemini API), and calculates an overall pass probability. The simulator adapts question difficulty based on the number of questions and user experience level.]
